# BenchRV32
A Verilog implementation for a RISC-V RV32I based microprocessor (classic 5-stage, in-order, single issue)

WORK IN PROGRESS: At this point, this microprocessor hasn't yet been tested. First iteration of design phase is mostly completed. 
Verification will be performed using already available open-source verification test suite.

# TO DO:
  - Bypassing Unit in Execution Stage module,
  - Full Branch Controller
  - Cache controller
  - Istruction & Data Cache
